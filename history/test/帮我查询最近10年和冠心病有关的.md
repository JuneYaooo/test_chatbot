### 1. Role of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the cardiorenal system: Unraveling crosstalk from the network of pollutants and phenotypes.

**摘要**: Although per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been frequently linked to cardiovascular and renal disease separately, evidence remains scarce regarding their systematic effect. Therefore, we recruited 546 newly diagnosed acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients and detected seven myocardial enzymes and six kidney function biomarkers. Twelve PFAS were also assessed with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Generalized linear model and restricted cubic spline model were applied to single pollutant analysis. Quantile g-computation was used for mixture analysis. Network model was utilized to identify central and bridge nodes of pollutants and phenotypes. In the present study, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid was positively associated with uric acid (UA) (β= 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01, 0.07), and perfluorobutanoic acid was negatively associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (β= -0.04, 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01) but positively associated with UA (β= 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06). In mixture analysis, each quantile increase in the PFAS mixture was significantly associated with UA (β= 0.08, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.11). Network analysis revealed that perfluorooctanoate, UA, and myoglobin were denoted as bridge nodes, and the first principal component of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase- myocardial band was identified as the node with the highest strength and expected influence. This study investigates the systematic impact of PFAS exposure through cardiorenal interaction network, which highlights that PFAS may serve as an upstream approach in UA-modulated cardiorenal network to affect cardiorenal system comprehensively.

### 2. Concordance Between DASH Diet and Coronary Artery Calcification: Results From the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) Prospective Cohort Study.

**摘要**: South Asian adults are at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, for which coronary artery calcification is an early predictor. Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet is a modifiable risk factor that may mitigate the progression of coronary artery calcification and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### 3. Ischemic Heart Disease in the Cancer Population: Trends, Outcomes, Epidemiology, and Challenges in Diagnosis and Treatment.

**DOI**: 10.1016/j.ccl.2024.08.001

**摘要**: Patients with cancer are at increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The increased risk of IHD in these patients is due to the interaction of shared risk factors, cancer type and stage, and immuno/chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens. Management of IHD in cancer patients is challenging, due to atypical presentation, increased thrombotic and bleeding risk, and worse outcomes compared to patients without cancer. In this review, we will discuss the trends, outcomes, epidemiology and challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of IHD among cancer patients.
