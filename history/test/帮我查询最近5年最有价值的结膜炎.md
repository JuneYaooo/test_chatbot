### 1. Allergic Conjunctivitis: An Update.

**作者**: Mueller, Arthur

**期刊**: Handbook of experimental pharmacology

**发表时间**: 2022

**DOI**: 10.1007/164_2021_491

**摘要**: Conjunctivitis is a frequent disease of the eye with the typical clinical sign being the "red eye" and comprises a very heterogeneous group with different causes. In general, infectious conjunctivitis must be strictly differentiated from non-infectious conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is a subtype of non-infectious conjunctivitis and imposes as an acute, intermittent or chronic, inflammation which is most frequently caused by airborne allergens. The leading clinical sign is chemosis, and patients typically complain about itching. Allergic conjunctivitis is often a reaction to topical and systemic drugs or cosmetics as well as animal hairs from cats and/or dogs. Allergic conjunctivitis is sub-classified into the following forms: seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (also termed: hay fever conjunctivitis), atopic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, upper limbal (kerato-) conjunctivitis, and conjunctivitis associated with various oculomucocutaneous syndromes. In each form, there are distinctive features in: clinical appearance, generating agent(s), as well as treatment as listed here.

### 2. Current Knowledge in Allergic Conjunctivitis.

**作者**: Villegas, Beatriz Vidal, Benitez-Del-Castillo, Jose Manuel

**期刊**: Turkish journal of ophthalmology

**发表时间**: 2021-Feb-25

**DOI**: 10.4274/tjo.galenos.2020.11456

**摘要**: Allergic conjunctivitis is a disease of increasing prevalence that affects both children and adults and causes significant deterioration of their quality of life and sometimes irreversible visual damage. There are various forms of the disease, some are allergen-induced such as seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis, and contact allergic blepharoconjunctivitis, whereas others are not always explained by allergen exposure, such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. We review their clinical course, characteristics, and differential diagnosis, and highlight recent advances in their pathophysiology and treatment.

### 3. Viral Conjunctivitis.

**作者**: Muto, Tetsuaya, Imaizumi, Shinichiro, Kamoi, Koju

**期刊**: Viruses

**发表时间**: 2023-Mar-04

**DOI**: 10.3390/v15030676

**摘要**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis and adenovirus; enterovirus and herpes virus are the common causative agents. In general, viral conjunctivitis spreads easily. Therefore, to control the spread, it is crucial to quickly diagnose illnesses, strictly implement hand washing laws, and sanitize surfaces. Swelling of the lid margin and ciliary injection are subjective symptoms, and eye discharge is frequently serofibrinous. Preauricular lymph node swelling can occasionally occur. Approximately 80% of cases of viral conjunctivitis are caused by adenoviruses. Adenoviral conjunctivitis may become a big global concern and may cause a pandemic. Diagnosis of herpes simplex viral conjunctivitis is crucial for using corticosteroid eye solution as a treatment for adenovirus conjunctivitis. Although specific treatments are not always accessible, early diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis may help to alleviate short-term symptoms and avoid long-term consequences.

### 4. Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis: A Systematic Review.

**作者**: Bruschi, Gaia, Ghiglioni, Daniele Giovanni, Cozzi, Laura, Osnaghi, Silvia, Viola, Francesco, Marchisio, Paola

**期刊**: Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology

**发表时间**: 2023

**DOI**: 10.1007/s12016-023-08970-4

**摘要**: Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic, bilateral corneal and conjunctival problem which typically presents in young individuals. VKC is characterized by itching, photophobia, white mucous discharge, lacrimation, foreign body sensation, and pain due to corneal involvement of shield ulcers. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is categorized within ocular diseases. The diagnosis is clinical, as no sure biomarkers pathognomonic of the disease have yet been identified. The VKC therapy relies on different types of drugs, from antihistamines and topical steroids to cyclosporine or tacrolimus eye drops. In extremely rare cases, there is also the need for surgical treatment for the debridement of ulcers, as well as for advanced glaucoma and cataracts, caused by excessive prolonged use of steroid eye drops. We performed a systematic review of the literature, according to PRISMA guideline recommendations. We searched the PubMed database from January 2016 to June 2023. Search terms were Vernal, Vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and VKC. We initially identified 211 articles. After the screening process, 168 studies were eligible according to our criteria and were included in the review. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive overview of currently available diagnostic methods, management of VKC, and its treatments.

### 5. Dupilumab-Associated Adverse Events During Treatment of Allergic Diseases.

**作者**: Kychygina, Anna, Cassagne, Myriam, Tauber, Marie, Galiacy, Stéphane, Paul, Carle, Fournié, Pierre, Simon, Michel

**期刊**: Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology

**发表时间**: 2022

**DOI**: 10.1007/s12016-022-08934-0

**摘要**: Among the new biological therapies for atopic diseases, dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against IL-4Rα, the common chain of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 receptors. Dupilumab showed clinical improvements in patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis and is currently under development for other indications. While dupilumab is considered to be well tolerated, a number of recent publications have reported various adverse events. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge about these adverse events, which may help clinicians to improve the follow-up of patients on dupilumab. Injection-site reactions are the most common reported adverse event. However, dupilumab has also been shown to cause ophthalmic complications (e.g., dry eyes, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, and ocular pruritus), head and neck dermatitis, onset of psoriatic lesions, progression of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma exacerbation, alopecia areata, hypereosinophilia, and arthritis. Most are managed during dupilumab treatment continuation, but some (e.g., severe conjunctivitis) may result in a discontinuation of treatment. Their molecular origin is unclear and requires further investigations. Among other hypothesis, it has been suggested that T helper (Th)2-mediated pathway inhibition may worsen Th1/Th17-dependent immune responses. An ophthalmological examination for the presence of potential predictive indicators of ophthalmic adverse events is recommended before initiation of dupilumab therapy.
