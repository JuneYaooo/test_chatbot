Lupus nephritis: new progress in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**作者**: Yu, Chen, Li, Ping, Dang, Xin, Zhang, Xuan, Mao, Yonghui, Chen, Xiangmei\n\n**期刊**: Journal of autoimmunity\n\n**发表时间**: 2022\n\n**DOI**: 10.1016/j.jaut.2022.102871\n\n**摘要**: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multifactorial autoimmune disease that affects many organs, including the kidney. Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common manifestation characterized by heterogeneous clinical and histopathological findings, and often associates with poor prognosis. The diagnosis and treatment of LN is challenging, depending largely on renal biopsy, and there is no reliable non-invasive LN biomarker. Up to now, the complete remission rate of LN is only 20%∼30% after receiving six months of standard treatment, which is far from satisfactory. Moreover, adverse reactions to immunosuppressants, especially glucocorticoids, further compromise the prognosis of LN. Biological reagents targetting autoimmune responses and inflammatory pathways, bring hope to the treatment of intractable lupus. The European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERA-EDTA) and KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) have been working on and launched the recommendations for the management of LN. In this review, we update our knowledge in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of LN and prospect for the future potential targets in the management of LN.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Lupus nephritis: clinical presentations and outcomes in the 21st century.\n\n**作者**: Gasparotto, Michela, Gatto, Mariele, Binda, Valentina, Doria, Andrea, Moroni, Gabriella\n\n**期刊**: Rheumatology (Oxford, England)\n\n**发表时间**: 2020-Dec-05\n\n**DOI**: 10.1093/rheumatology/keaa381\n\n**摘要**: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a frequent and severe manifestation of SLE. Along the decades, the epidemiology of LN and its clinical presentation have been changing. However, even though retrospective cohort studies report a decreased mortality rate and an improvement in the disease prognosis, the percentage of patients progressing into end stage renal disease (ESRD) keeps steady despite the improvements in therapeutic strategies. Current in-use medications have been available for decades now, yet over the years, regimens for optimizing their efficacy and minimizing toxicity have been developed. Therapeutic research is now moving towards the direction of precision medicine and several new drugs, targeting selectively different pathogenetic pathways, are currently under evaluation with promising results. In this review, we address the main changes and persistent unmet needs in LN management throughout the past decades, with a focus on prognosis and upcoming treatments.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Glomerulonephritis.\n\n**作者**: Keskinyan, Vahakn Shant, Lattanza, Brittany, Reid-Adam, Jessica\n\n**期刊**: Pediatrics in review\n\n**发表时间**: 2023-Sep-01\n\n**DOI**: 10.1542/pir.2021-005259\n\n**摘要**: Glomerulonephritis (GN) encompasses several disorders that cause glomerular inflammation and injury through an interplay of immune-mediated mechanisms, host characteristics, and environmental triggers, such as infections. GN can manifest solely in the kidney or in the setting of a systemic illness, and presentation can range from chronic and relatively asymptomatic hematuria to fulminant renal failure. Classic acute GN is characterized by hematuria, edema, and hypertension, the latter 2 of which are the consequence of sodium and water retention in the setting of renal impairment. Although presenting signs and symptoms and a compatible clinical history can suggest GN, serologic and urinary testing can further refine the differential diagnosis, and renal biopsy can be used for definitive diagnosis. Treatment of GN can include supportive care, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, immunomodulatory therapy, and renal transplant. Prognosis is largely dependent on the underlying cause of GN and can vary from a self-limited course to chronic kidney disease. This review focuses on lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, IgA vasculitis, and postinfectious GN.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Diagnosis and treatment of IgA nephropathy and IgA vasculitis nephritis in Chinese children.\n\n**作者**: Zhong, Xuhui, Ding, Jie\n\n**期刊**: Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)\n\n**发表时间**: 2023\n\n**DOI**: 10.1007/s00467-022-05798-6\n\n**摘要**: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and IgA vasculitis-associated nephritis (IgAVN) are among the most frequent childhood glomerular diseases and are characterized by significant variability in clinical manifestations, pathological presentation and long-term outcomes. IgAVN, alternatively called purpura nephritis, is pathologically indistinguishable from kidney-limited IgAN. In Chinese children, the clinical presentations and pathological manifestations of IgAN and IgAVN are variable. The severity of proteinuria and abnormalities in kidney function and blood pressure of children in China are comparable to those of children in Europe, the USA, and Japan. Compared to Caucasian children and Japanese children, crescents were more common in Chinese children with IgAN or IgAVN. Approximately 10-20% of childhood IgAN or IgAVN progresses to impaired kidney function in China. Since 2007, a series of guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric kidney diseases has been published following the principles of evidence-based medicine. However, a large difference exists between the Chinese evidence-based guidelines and the guidelines developed by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2021. Chinese children with IgAN or IgAVN were more likely to be treated with steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Further studies exploring the optimal treatment regimen for childhood IgAN or IgAVN are needed in the future.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Lupus Podocytopathy: An Overview.\n\n**作者**: Oliva-Damaso, Nestor, Payan, Juan, Oliva-Damaso, Elena, Pereda, Teresa, Bomback, Andrew S\n\n**期刊**: Advances in chronic kidney disease\n\n**发表时间**: 2019\n\n**DOI**: 10.1053/j.ackd.2019.08.011\n\n**摘要**: In systemic lupus erythematosus, nephrotic-range proteinuria typically signals the presence of a proliferative lupus nephritis (class III/IV) and/or membranous lupus nephritis (class V, with or without concomitant class III or IV lesions). However, in rare instances, systemic lupus erythematosus patients with nephrotic syndrome have kidney biopsy findings of normal glomeruli or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions, with or without mesangial proliferation, on light microscopy; the absence of subepithelial or subendothelial deposits on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy; and diffuse foot process effacement on electron microscopy. This pattern, termed lupus podocytopathy, is a unique form of lupus nephritis that mimics minimal change disease or primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and represents approximately 1% of lupus nephritis biopsies. Here we review the clinical features, histological manifestations, diagnostic criteria and classification, pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis of lupus podocytopathy.\n\n---\n\n### 6. IgA vasculitis.\n\n**作者**: Pillebout, Evangéline, Sunderkötter, Cord\n\n**期刊**: Seminars in immunopathology\n\n**发表时间**: 2021\n\n**DOI**: 10.1007/s00281-021-00874-9\n\n**摘要**: IgA vasculitis (IgAV) is an inflammation of small vessels caused by perivascular deposition of IgA and activation of neutrophils. It may present as systemic vasculitis (IgAV - Henoch-Schönlein purpura) or as a variant restricted to the skin (skin-limited IgAV), while IgA nephropathy presents a variant restricted to the kidneys. Systemic IgAV affects children more frequently than adults (150 to 200 for 1; incidence 1 in 1 million/year). In the latter, disease more often leads to chronic renal disease. The dominant clinical features include round or oval and retiform palpable purpura predominantly on the lower legs, arthralgia or arthritis, gastrointestinal bleeding or pain and glomerulonephritis with mesangial IgA deposits (IgAVN). Pulmonary, cardiac, genital and neurological involvement occurs, but is rare. Immune complexes containing galactose-deficient IgA1 play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of IgAV; via the Fc alpha receptor (CD89), they induce neutrophilic inflammation around cutaneous vessels and mesangial proliferation and inflammation in the glomerulus. In case of self-limited disease, only symptomatic treatment is recommended. Treatment of severe IgAV, nephritis or gastrointestinal manifestations, is not established, but some studies reported a benefit of corticosteroids, combined with immunosuppressive drugs. Short-term outcome depends on the severity of gastrointestinal manifestations, while long-term prognosis depends on the severity of nephritis.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Executive summary of the KDIGO 2021 Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases.\n\n**作者**: Rovin, Brad H, Adler, Sharon G, Barratt, Jonathan, Bridoux, Frank, Burdge, Kelly A, Chan, Tak Mao, Cook, H Terence, Fervenza, Fernando C, Gibson, Keisha L, Glassock, Richard J, Jayne, David R W, Jha, Vivekanand, Liew, Adrian, Liu, Zhi-Hong, Mejía-Vilet, Juan M, Nester, Carla M, Radhakrishnan, Jai, Rave, Elizabeth M, Reich, Heather N, Ronco, Pierre, Sanders, Jan-Stephan F, Sethi, Sanjeev, Suzuki, Yusuke, Tang, Sydney C W, Tesar, Vladimír, Vivarelli, Marina, Wetzels, Jack F M, Lytvyn, Lyubov, Craig, Jonathan C, Tunnicliffe, David J, Howell, Martin, Tonelli, Marcello A, Cheung, Michael, Earley, Amy, Floege, Jürgen\n\n**期刊**: Kidney international\n\n**发表时间**: 2021\n\n**DOI**: 10.1016/j.kint.2021.05.015\n\n**摘要**: The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases is an update to the KDIGO 2012 guideline. The aim is to assist clinicians caring for individuals with glomerulonephritis (GN), both adults and children. The scope includes various glomerular diseases, including IgA nephropathy and IgA vasculitis, membranous nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome, minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), infection-related GN, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis, lupus nephritis, and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody GN. In addition, this guideline will be the first to address the subtype of complement-mediated diseases. Each chapter follows the same format providing guidance related to diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and special situations. The goal of the guideline is to generate a useful resource for clinicians and patients by providing actionable recommendations based on evidence syntheses, with useful infographics incorporating views from experts in the field. Another aim is to propose research recommendations for areas where there are gaps in knowledge. The guideline targets a broad global audience of clinicians treating GN while being mindful of implications for policy and cost. Development of this guideline update followed an explicit process whereby treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies, and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the \"Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation\" (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, with areas of future research also presented.\n\n---\n\n"
