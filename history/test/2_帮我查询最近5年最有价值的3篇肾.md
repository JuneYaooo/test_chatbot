### 3. Urologic Imaging: Infections and Inflammation.

**作者**: O'Shea, Aileen

**期刊**: The Urologic clinics of North America

**发表时间**: 2025

**DOI**: 10.1016/j.ucl.2024.07.006

**摘要**: Urinary infections are common. Typically, infections of the upper and lower urinary tract do not require imaging. However, in the presence of confirmed or suspected complicated urinary tract infections, imaging to assess for underlying causes and complications is required. Computed tomography imaging is useful in identifying predisposing structural abnormalities of the urinary tracts and complications of urologic infection. Ultrasonography can be used to identify hydronephrosis and may be used to guide percutaneous intervention. Recurrent chronic infections can lead to end organ damage or chronic granulomatous processes. Rarely, systemic inflammatory disorders can involve the upper and lower urinary tracts.
