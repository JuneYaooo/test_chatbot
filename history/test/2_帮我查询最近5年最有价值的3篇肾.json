Integrative multi-omics and network pharmacology reveal the mechanisms of Fangji Huangqi Decoction in treating IgA nephropathy.\n\n**作者**: Liu, Tao, Zhuang, Xing Xing, Zheng, Wen Jia, Gao, Jia Rong\n\n**期刊**: Journal of ethnopharmacology\n\n**发表时间**: 2025-Jan-30\n\n**DOI**: 10.1016/j.jep.2024.118996\n\n**摘要**: Fangji Huangqi Decoction (FJHQD), a classical Chinese herbal formulation, has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), although its mechanisms remain poorly understood.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Downregulation of ferroptosis-related ATF3 alleviates lupus nephritis progression.\n\n**作者**: Xiao, Gong, Tang, Shumei, Zhang, Yan, Yuan, Qiongjing, Sun, Danni, Wang, Wei\n\n**期刊**: Gene\n\n**发表时间**: 2025-Jan-20\n\n**DOI**: 10.1016/j.gene.2024.149009\n\n**摘要**: The role of ferroptosis in lupus nephritis (LN) is unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of ferroptosis-related genes in LN through bioinformatics prediction and experimental validation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Urologic Imaging: Infections and Inflammation.\n\n**作者**: O'Shea, Aileen\n\n**期刊**: The Urologic clinics of North America\n\n**发表时间**: 2025\n\n**DOI**: 10.1016/j.ucl.2024.07.006\n\n**摘要**: Urinary infections are common. Typically, infections of the upper and lower urinary tract do not require imaging. However, in the presence of confirmed or suspected complicated urinary tract infections, imaging to assess for underlying causes and complications is required. Computed tomography imaging is useful in identifying predisposing structural abnormalities of the urinary tracts and complications of urologic infection. Ultrasonography can be used to identify hydronephrosis and may be used to guide percutaneous intervention. Recurrent chronic infections can lead to end organ damage or chronic granulomatous processes. Rarely, systemic inflammatory disorders can involve the upper and lower urinary tracts.\n\n---\n\n"
