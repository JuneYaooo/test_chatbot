### 1. Glomerulonephritis: immunopathogenesis and immunotherapy

**作者**: Anders, Hans-Joachim, Kitching, A. Richard, Leung, Nelson, Romagnani, Paola

**期刊**: Nature Reviews. Immunology

**发表时间**: 2023-01-12

**DOI**: 10.1038/s41577-022-00816-y

**摘要**: ‘Glomerulonephritis’ (GN) is a term used to describe a group of heterogeneous immune-mediated disorders characterized by inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney (the glomeruli). These disorders are currently classified largely on the basis of histopathological lesion patterns, but these patterns do not align well with their diverse pathological mechanisms and hence do not inform optimal therapy. Instead, we propose grouping GN disorders into five categories according to their immunopathogenesis: infection-related GN, autoimmune GN, alloimmune GN, autoinflammatory GN and monoclonal gammopathy-related GN. This categorization can inform the appropriate treatment; for example, infection control for infection-related GN, suppression of adaptive immunity for autoimmune GN and alloimmune GN, inhibition of single cytokines or complement factors for autoinflammatory GN arising from inborn errors in innate immunity, and plasma cell clone-directed or B cell clone-directed therapy for monoclonal gammopathies. Here we present the immunopathogenesis of GN and immunotherapies in use and in development and discuss how an immunopathogenesis-based GN classification can focus research, and improve patient management and teaching.

### 2. Glomerulonephritis.

**作者**: Keskinyan, Vahakn Shant, Lattanza, Brittany, Reid-Adam, Jessica

**发表时间**: 2023-Sep-01

**DOI**: 10.1542/pir.2021-005259

**摘要**: Glomerulonephritis (GN) encompasses several disorders that cause glomerular inflammation and injury through an interplay of immune-mediated mechanisms, host characteristics, and environmental triggers, such as infections. GN can manifest solely in the kidney or in the setting of a systemic illness, and presentation can range from chronic and relatively asymptomatic hematuria to fulminant renal failure. Classic acute GN is characterized by hematuria, edema, and hypertension, the latter 2 of which are the consequence of sodium and water retention in the setting of renal impairment. Although presenting signs and symptoms and a compatible clinical history can suggest GN, serologic and urinary testing can further refine the differential diagnosis, and renal biopsy can be used for definitive diagnosis. Treatment of GN can include supportive care, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, immunomodulatory therapy, and renal transplant. Prognosis is largely dependent on the underlying cause of GN and can vary from a self-limited course to chronic kidney disease. This review focuses on lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, IgA vasculitis, and postinfectious GN.

**摘要**: Numerous cases of glomerulonephritis manifesting shortly after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported, but causality remains unproven. Here, we studied the association between mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and new-onset glomerulonephritis using a nationwide retrospective cohort and a case-cohort design. Data from all Swiss pathology institutes processing native kidney biopsies served to calculate incidence of IgA nephropathy, pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease, and membranous nephropathy in the adult Swiss population. The observed incidence during the vaccination campaign (January to August 2021) was not different from the expected incidence calculated using a Bayesian model based on the years 2015 to 2019 (incidence rate ratio 0.86, 95% credible interval 0.73–1.02) and did not cross the upper boundary of the 95% credible interval for any month. Among 111 patients 18 years and older with newly diagnosed glomerulonephritis between January and August 2021, 38.7% had received at least one vaccine dose before biopsy, compared to 39.5% of the general Swiss population matched for age and calendar-time. The estimated risk ratio for the development of new-onset biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis was not significant at 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.66–1.42) in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals. Patients with glomerulonephritis manifesting within four weeks after vaccination did not differ clinically from those manifesting temporally unrelated to vaccination. Thus, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with new-onset glomerulonephritis in these two complementary studies with most temporal associations between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and glomerulonephritis likely coincidental.

### 6. Blocking of inflammatory heparan sulfate domains by specific antibodies is not protective in experimental glomerulonephritis

**摘要**: Glomerulonephritis is an acquired serious glomerular disease, which involves the interplay of many factors such as cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory cells, and heparan sulfate (HS). We previously showed that blocking of inflammatory heparan sulfate domains on cultured glomerular endothelium by specific anti-HS single chain antibodies reduced polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) adhesion and chemokine binding. We hypothesized that injection of anti-HS antibodies in PMN-driven experimental glomerulonephritis should reduce glomerular influx of PMNs and thereby lead to a better renal outcome. In contrast to our hypothesis, co-injection of anti-HS antibodies did not alter the final outcome of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM)-induced glomerulonephritis. Glomerular PMN influx, normally peaking 2 hours after induction of glomerulonephritis with anti-GBM IgG was not reduced by co-injection of anti-HS antibodies. Four days after induction of glomerulonephritis, albuminuria, renal function, glomerular hyalinosis and fibrin deposition were similar in mice treated and not treated with anti-HS antibodies. Interestingly, we observed transient effects in mice co-injected with anti-HS antibodies compared to mice that did not receive anti-HS antibodies: (i) a decreased renal function 2 hours and 1 day after induction of glomerulonephritis; (ii) an increased albuminuria after 2 hours and 1 day; (iii) an increased glomerular fibrin deposition after 1 day; (iv) a reduced glomerular macrophage influx after 1 day; (v) a sustained glomerular presence of PMNs at day 1 and 4, accompanied by an increased renal expression of IL-6, CXCL1, ICAM-1, L-selectin, CD11b and NF-κB. The mechanism underlying these observations induced by anti-HS antibodies remains unclear, but may be explained by a temporarily altered glycocalyx and/or altered function of PMNs due to the binding of anti-HS antibodies. Nevertheless, the evaluated anti-HS antibodies do not show therapeutic potential in anti-GBM-induced glomerulonephritis. Future research should evaluate other strategies to target HS domains involved in inflammatory processes during glomerulonephritis.

### 7. Infection-Related Glomerulonephritis.

**作者**: Hunt, Elizabeth A K, Somers, Michael J G

**期刊**: Pediatric clinics of North America

**发表时间**: 2019

**DOI**: 10.1016/j.pcl.2018.08.005

**摘要**: Acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis or infection-related glomerulonephritis has been associated with several viral or bacterial infections. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection is the prototypical cause of postinfectious glomerulonephritis and the main focus of this discussion. The clinical spectrum can vary widely, from asymptomatic microscopic hematuria incidentally detected on routine urinalysis to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with acute kidney injury requiring emergent dialysis. Other important causes include glomerulonephritis associated with endocarditis and ventriculoatrial shunt infections. Multiple renal pathologic conditions have been associated with hepatitis B and C infections.

### 8. Retinal drusen in glomerulonephritis with or without immune deposits suggest systemic complement activation in disease pathogenesis

**摘要**: Retinal drusen are characteristic of macular degeneration and complement activation, but also occur in C3, lupus and IgA nephropathy. This cross-sectional observational study compared drusen counts in different forms of glomerulonephritis. Consecutive individuals with glomerulonephritis attending a general renal or transplant clinic underwent retinal imaging with a non-mydriatic camera. Drusen were counted in deidentified images by trained graders, compared with matched hospital patients, and correlated with clinical features. Eighty-four individuals with glomerulonephritis had a mean drusen count of 10 ± 27 compared with 3 ± 8 in hospital controls (p = 0.007). Fourteen individuals with glomerulonephritis (17%) and 4 hospital controls (4/49, 8%) had increased drusen counts (≥ 10) (p = 0.20). Increased drusen counts ≥ 10 were present in 13 (13/63, 21%)  of those with glomerulonephritis and immune deposits [membranous (n = 8), antiglomerular basement membrane nephritis (n = 6), FSGS (n = 49)], and one of the 21 (5%) with glomerulonephritis without immune deposits [ANCA-associated (n = 15), minimal change disease (n = 6)]. In antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis (n = 14), mean drusen counts were 2 ± 3 in individuals with normal kidney function, 16 ± 41 with impaired function and 5 ± 7 with kidney failure . Mean counts were 24 ± 56 in individuals with glomerular IgG deposits and 1 ± 1 in those without (p = 0.76), and 23 ± 60 with complement deposits and 4 ± 8 in those without. Drusen counts were also less in immunosuppressed individuals (p = 0.049). The demonstration of retinal drusen in some forms of glomerulonephritis is consistent with systemic complement activation, and suggests that treatment targeting the complement pathways is worthwhile.

**摘要**: A kidney biopsy is done to determine the etiology of the glomerulonephritis (GN) and the severity of the lesion, to identify whether other lesions, related to or not related to the GN, are present on the kidney biopsy and finally to ascertain the extent of chronicity of the GN. The etiology of GN is based on the classification of GN into five groups: immune complex-mediated GN, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated GN, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) GN, monoclonal immunoglobulin-mediated GN and C3 glomerulopathy. Immune complex GN includes multiple specific diseases such as lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, infection-related GN and fibrillary GN. ANCA GN, anti-GBM GN and C3 glomerulopathy are specific diseases in themselves, while monoclonal Ig GN includes proliferative GN with monoclonal Ig deposits and monoclonal Ig deposition disease. Thus identification of the class of GN and within it the specific disease determines the etiology of GN. Ancillary studies may be required to confirm the etiology of GN. The severity of the GN is revealed by the pattern of injury, such as crescentic, necrotizing, diffuse proliferative, exudative, membranoproliferative, mesangial proliferative or a sclerosing GN. Secondary diagnosis either related or unrelated to the GN, such as diabetic glomerulosclerosis, acute tubular necrosis or thrombotic microangiopathy, may also be present. The secondary diagnosis may sometimes be the reason for the kidney biopsy. The chronicity of GN is determined by evaluating the extent of glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and vascular sclerosis present on the biopsy. This review summarizes the approach to standardizing a kidney biopsy report that includes these components in a logical and sequential manner.

### 10. Acute Postinfectious Glomerulonephritis.

**作者**: Duong, Minh Dien, Reidy, Kimberly J

**期刊**: Pediatric clinics of North America

**发表时间**: 2022

**DOI**: 10.1016/j.pcl.2022.08.001

**摘要**: Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is a leading cause of acute glomerulonephritis in children. The presentation of PIGN can vary from asymptomatic microscopic hematuria incidentally detected on routine urinalysis to nephritic syndrome and a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Treatment involves supportive care with salt and water restriction, and the use of diuretic and/or antihypertensive medication, depending on the severity of fluid retention and the presence of hypertension. PIGN resolves completely and spontaneously in most children, and the long-term outcomes are typically good with preserved renal function and no recurrence.
