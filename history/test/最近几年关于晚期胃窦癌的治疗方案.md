- Recent advances in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer (胃窦癌) have focused on several key areas, including surgical techniques, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies. Here are some of the most relevant findings from recent literature:

1. **Surgical Treatment**:
   - **Lymph Node Dissection**: Advanced gastric cancer often involves lymph node metastasis, making lymph node dissection a crucial part of surgical treatment. Recent studies have explored the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic surgery for early gastric cancer, but the treatment models for advanced gastric cancer still require further exploration and validation (Tan et al., 2019).
   - **Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC)**: HIPEC combined with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) has shown promise in reducing the rate of peritoneal metastasis in patients with advanced gastric cancer. HIPEC alters the transcription of many genes by affecting non-coding RNAs, which may contribute to its suppressive effect on cancer cell growth (Zeng et al., 2022).

2. **Chemotherapy**:
   - **Perioperative Chemotherapy**: For resectable gastric cancer, perioperative chemotherapy has become the standard treatment. Ongoing investigations are exploring the potential benefits of targeted therapy or immunotherapy in the perioperative or adjuvant setting (Guan et al., 2023).
   - **Sequential Chemotherapy**: Advanced gastric cancer is treated with sequential lines of chemotherapy, starting with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet in the first line. Median survival is less than 1 year, but targeted therapies and immunotherapies are changing this prognosis (Smyth et al., 2020).

3. **Immunotherapy**:
   - **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs)**: ICIs have become an effective treatment modality for gastric cancer. Trastuzumab is used for HER2-positive patients in the first line, while ramucirumab is used in the second line. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are used in the third line (Smyth et al., 2020).
   - **Predictive Biomarkers**: The efficacy of immunotherapy is often guided by biomarkers such as PD-L1, microsatellite instability (MSI), and HER2. These biomarkers help differentiate patients who may benefit from immunotherapy or targeted therapy (Li et al., 2021).

4. **Targeted Therapies**:
   - **HER2-Targeted Therapy**: Trastuzumab has been shown to improve outcomes in HER2-positive gastric cancer patients (Smyth et al., 2020).
   - **Anti-Angiogenic Therapy**: Ramucirumab, an anti-angiogenic agent, is used in the second-line setting for advanced gastric cancer (Smyth et al., 2020).

5. **Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) Guidelines**:
   - The 2023 update of the CSCO Clinical Guidelines for Gastric Cancer includes new recommendations for immunotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapy, and targeted drugs. It also provides detailed screening recommendations for hereditary gastric cancer and an appendix listing drug treatment regimens for various stages of gastric cancer (Wang et al., 2023).

These recent advancements reflect a shift towards more personalized and targeted treatments for advanced gastric cancer, aiming to improve patient outcomes and survival rates.
